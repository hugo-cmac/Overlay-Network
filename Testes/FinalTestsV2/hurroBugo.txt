SHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.

You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun!

Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

(smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again!

No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...

(cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are!

Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)

SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...

(smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...

If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence!

HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt...

One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey!

DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me.

In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese.

Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing.

HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army?

The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me.

DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them?

GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre!

(makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...

(cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army?

Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me.

If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon.

It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail.

He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off.

DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.

Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine.

FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man.

People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest?

DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you?

They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?

(awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there!

Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are!

MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away.

We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey.

(smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...

DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over.

The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around.

He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...

That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.

HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt...

DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me.

In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them?

GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house?

Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing.

One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there.

Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me.

In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them?

GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me.

DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail.

Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off.

In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out.

DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

(drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

(drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.

That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods.

The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary.

GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others?

Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool.

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

(Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up!

(his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.

(awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there!

Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One?

I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou kSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOMEMAN1Think it's in there?MAN2All right. Let's get it!MAN1Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? MAN3Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.SHREKYes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are!

MENNo!SHREKThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. MAN1Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark. SHREKThis is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)  THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs. GUARDAll right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! HEAD GUARDNext!GUARD(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) HEAD GUARDThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! GUARDGet up! Come on!HEAD GUARDTwenty pieces.LITTLE BEAR(crying) This cage is too small.DONKEYPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! OLD WOMANOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)DONKEYOh!HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?GIPETTOThis little wooden puppet.PINOCCHIOI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows) HEAD GUARDFive shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. PINOCCHIOFather, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table. HEAD GUARDNext! What have you got?OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.HEAD GUARDRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. OLD WOMANOh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her.HEAD GUARDWell?OLD WOMANOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt... HEAD GUARDThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards! OLD WOMANNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. HEAD GUARDGet her out of my sight.OLD WOMANNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly. DONKEYHey! I can fly!PETER PANHe can fly!3 LITTLE PIGSHe can fly!HEAD GUARDHe can talk!DONKEYHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.HEAD GUARDSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! GUARDSHe's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek. HEAD GUARDYou there. Ogre!SHREKAye?HEAD GUARDBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. SHREKOh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage. DONKEYCan I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! SHREKAre you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! DONKEYYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. SHREKOh, that's great. Really.DONKEYMan, it's good to be free.SHREKNow, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? DONKEYBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly. DONKEYOh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. SHREKWhy are you following me?DONKEYI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith... SHREKStop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. DONKEYWow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. SHREKListen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? DONKEY(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall? SHREKNo! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? DONKEYNope.SHREKReally?DONKEYReally, really.SHREKOh.DONKEYMan, I like you. What's you name?SHREKUh, Shrek.DONKEYShrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? SHREKThat would be my home.DONKEYOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? SHREKI like my privacy.DONKEYYou know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you? SHREKUh, what?DONKEYCan I stay with you, please?SHREK(sarcastically) Of course!DONKEYReally?SHREKNo.DONKEYPlease! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! SHREKOkay! Okay! But one night only.DONKEYAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) SHREKWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! DONKEYThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. SHREKOh!DONKEYWhere do, uh, I sleep?SHREK(irritated) Outside!DONKEYOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff. SHREK(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. DONKEY(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table. BLIND MOUSE1Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? BLIND MOUSE2It's not home, but it'll do just fine. GORDO(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. SHREKGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) GORDOI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's ear) SHREKOw!GORDOBlah! Awful stuff.BLIND MOUSE1Is that you, Gordo?GORDOHow did you know?SHREKEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. DWARFWhere are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. SHREKHuh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him. BIG BAD WOLFWhat? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door. SHREKI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.  SHREKWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.)  Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent. SHREKAll right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) DONKEYHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. PINOCCHIOOh, gosh, no one invited us.SHREKWhat?PINOCCHIOWe were forced to come here.SHREK(flabbergasted) By who?LITTLE PIGLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. SHREK(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.DONKEYOh, I do. I know where he is.SHREKDoes anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? DONKEYMe! Me!SHREKAnyone?DONKEYOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! SHREK(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. DONKEYAll right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! DONKEY(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. SHREKWhat did I say about singing?DONKEYCan I whistle?SHREKNo.DONKEYCan I hum it?SHREKAll right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC - KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. FARQUAADThat's enough. He's ready to talk.  The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.  FARQUAAD(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. GINGERBREAD MANYou are a monster.FARQUAADI'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? GINGERBREAD MANEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.) FARQUAADI've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) GINGERBREAD MANNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. FARQUAADAll right then. Who's hiding them? GINGERBREAD MANOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man.FARQUAADYes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? GINGERBREAD MANWell, she's married to the muffin man. FARQUAADThe muffin man?GINGERBREAD MANThe muffin man!FARQUAADShe's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.HEAD GUARDMy lord! We found it.FARQUAADThen what are you waiting for? Bring it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror. GINGERBREAD MAN(in awe) Ohhhh...FARQUAADMagic mirror...GINGERBREAD MANDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No! FARQUAADEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? MIRRORWell, technically you're not a king. FARQUAADUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? MIRRORWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. FARQUAADGo on.MIRROR(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? GUARDSTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! FARQUAADThree? One? Three?THELONIUSThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! FARQUAADOkay, okay, uh, number three!MIRRORLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. FARQUAADPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... MIRRORBut I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. FARQUAADI'll do it.MIRRORYes, but after sunset...FARQUAADSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. DONKEYBut that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. SHREKSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. DONKEYUh-huh. That's the place.SHREKDo you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) DONKEYHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.MANHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. SHREKHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC They look around but all is quiet.SHREKIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? DONKEYHey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing. WOODEN PEOPLEWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town  Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.DONKEYWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) SHREK(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.FARQUAADBrave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. SHREKAll right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. DONKEYSorry about that.FARQUAADThat champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! SHREK(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. FARQUAADIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! MENGet him!SHREKOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) CROWDGo ahead! Get him!SHREK(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? CROWDKill the beast!SHREKNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt. DONKEYHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. SHREKYeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him. WOMANThe chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. SHREKOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek. HEAD GUARDShall I give the order, sir?FARQUAADNo, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! SHREKWhat?FARQUAADCongratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. SHREKQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. FARQUAADYour swamp?SHREKYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! FARQUAADIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. SHREKExactly the way it was?FARQUAADDown to the last slime-covered toadstool. SHREKAnd the squatters?FARQUAADAs good as gone.SHREKWhat kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion. DONKEYLet me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right? SHREKYou k
